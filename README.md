# TransportHelper - Seattle
Scenario

Bikes/Scooters have served as a popular solution to the last mile transportation requirements of many commuters taking bus lines, 
with over 2.2 million trips logged in 2019 itself. In recent years, however, commuting rates have been falling dramatically,
reaching a 10-year low in Seattle (Guy). This downfall can stem from many inconveniences associated with these modes of transportation. 
For example, some areas have less than ideal sidewalk conditions, or even lack them entirely, and it might be tough for certain last
mile solutions like scooters to function in these conditions. I would like to address this issue by using the large amount of publicly
available real-time data currently available.


Considering the nature of the problem, I have decided to make a mobile application using Android Studio to represent publicly available
information on bus locations and sidewalk conditions. 
CityTrack uses public databases and APIs to gather information important for the average commuter and represent them on an easy-to-read map. 

Data Currently Represented: 
Sidewalks-API | City of Seattle Open Data Portal. 2 Dec. 2021, data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Sidewalks-API/cib3-nanr.
MapBox API for bus locations.
